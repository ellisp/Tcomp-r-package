\usage{
forecast_comp(the_series, tests = list(the_series$h), plot = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{the_series}{a list of class \code{Mdata} eg from the \code{Mcomp} or \code{Tcomp} package.  Crucially, must include elements \code{x} (the training set), \code{xx} (the test set) and \code{h} (the forecast horizon)}

\item{tests}{a list of the forecast horizons over which to return the MASE, passed to \code{accuracy}}

\item{plot}{whether or not to draw basic plot of the four forecast model}

\item{...}{other parameters to pass to \code{plot.forecast()}}
}
\description{
Applies four modelling strategies (ARIMA, ETS, Theta and naive or seasonally naive) to a dataset
with class Mdata, returns MASE statistics and (optionall) a summary graphic
}
